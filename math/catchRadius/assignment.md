1. Is the player
2. Is the player's "collect item radius" (the dot in the center of the square represents the center of the catch radius)
3. This is the item on the screen (the dot at the center represents the center of the item)

Write me a function that takes in the point coordinates at the center of the catch radius (cx, cy), the catch radius itself (cr), and then the point coordinates at the center of the item (ix, iy)

If (ix, iy) is INSIDE the catch radius circle, return the boolean value true. Otherwise, return false
